# Project_Voyageur

The Github repo for our FMP

### Description
We are a team of games designers at the University of Southampton and we are creating a relaxing game set in Canada's Boreal forest. Having the player explore areas both on land and in a canoe, we want the player to create their own journey and focus on what's happening right now, rather than their end goal. We aim for the game to be a peaceful, and mindful experience that the player can enjoy in moments of stress, and to allow them to explore in peace. 

### Issue Tracking
We will be play testing our game extensively and ask each player to report any feedback [here](https://github.com/bluenell/Project_Voyageur/issues/new "Report Issues")

This get's automatically added to our to-do list!
